Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement an autonomous trolley bag that utilizes facial recognition technology to follow a person seamlessly. By integrating OpenCV for facial detection and Arduino IDE for controlling the movement of Omni wheels, the project aims to create a reliable and user-friendly system for hands-free luggage navigation. 

The primary goal is to enhance the travel experience by reducing the burden of manually dragging or monitoring luggage, especially in crowded or busy environments such as airports, train stations, or urban streets. The autonomous trolley bag will offer travellers a convenient solution for effortlessly transporting their belongings, allowing them to move freely and focus on other tasks without worrying about their luggage.

Furthermore, the project seeks to showcase the potential of combining computer vision and robotics to create practical and innovative solutions in everyday scenarios. By demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology integration, the project aims to inspire further research and development in autonomous systems.

Ultimately, the objective is to deliver a functional prototype of the autonomous trolley bag that is reliable, intuitive to use, and capable of autonomously tracking and following its owner, thereby offering a glimpse into the future of smart luggage technology.





Introduction
Welcome to the innovative world of autonomous travel companionship – where cutting-edge technology meets practical convenience. This project introduces an autonomous trolley bag, a revolutionary solution designed to streamline the travel experience by leveraging the power of facial recognition and robotics.

In today's fast-paced world, navigating through bustling airports, crowded terminals, and urban landscapes can often be a daunting task, especially when burdened with the responsibility of dragging heavy luggage. This project aims to alleviate this burden by introducing a smart and intuitive solution that autonomously follows its owner, freeing them from the hassle of constantly monitoring their belongings.

By harnessing the capabilities of OpenCV for facial detection and Arduino IDE for controlling omni-wheel movement, this project offers a seamless fusion of computer vision and robotics. The result? A sophisticated system that intelligently tracks and follows the user, providing unparalleled convenience and peace of mind.

But this project is more than just a practical solution for hands-free luggage navigation; it represents a glimpse into the future of smart technology integration. Showcasing the potential of combining advanced algorithms with robotics, opens the door to a world of possibilities in autonomous systems and human-computer interaction.

Join us on this journey as we explore the intersection of technology and convenience, and embark on a quest to redefine the way we travel. Welcome to the autonomous trolley bag project – where innovation knows no bounds.
Problem Statement

1. Manual Luggage Management: Traditional luggage systems require travellers to manually drag or carry their bags, which can be tiresome and burdensome, especially in crowded or busy environments.

2. Limited Mobility: Individuals with disabilities or limited physical strength may face even greater challenges in managing their luggage independently, limiting their mobility and travel opportunities.

3. Stressful Travel Experience: The need to constantly monitor luggage adds to the stress of travel, detracting from the overall experience and enjoyment of the journey.

4. Crowded Environments: Navigating through crowded airports, train stations, or urban streets while managing luggage can be challenging and overwhelming, leading to inefficiency and frustration.

5. Dependency on Assistance: Many travellers rely on assistance from others to manage their luggage, which can be inconvenient and may compromise their sense of independence.

6. Safety Concerns: In busy environments, there is a risk of luggage being lost, stolen, or misplaced, further adding to the anxiety and stress of travel.
 
Solution Statement

The problem statement addressed by this project is the inconvenience and burden associated with manually navigating and monitoring luggage in crowded and dynamic environments. Traditional luggage systems require constant attention from the traveller, hindering their ability to move freely and focus on other tasks. This becomes particularly challenging in crowded spaces like airports, train stations, or urban streets, where manoeuvring through crowds while managing luggage can be stressful and exhausting.

Additionally, the lack of hands-free solutions limits the mobility and independence of individuals with disabilities or those with limited physical strength, further exacerbating the problem of travel accessibility.

This project aims to solve these challenges by offering a hands-free solution for luggage navigation by developing an autonomous trolley bag that utilizes facial recognition technology and Omni wheel control. This system will autonomously follow its owner, reducing the need for manual intervention and providing a seamless travel experience. By addressing these issues, the project aims to enhance travel convenience, alleviate stress, and improve accessibility for all travellers, ultimately redefining the way we approach luggage management in modern travel scenarios.
